# 🎯 Number Guessing Game 🎮

## 📌 Description
This is a simple **Number Guessing Game** written in **C++**. The program randomly selects a number, and the user must guess it. The game provides hints like "Too high" or "Too low" until the correct number is guessed.

## 🚀 Features
- 🎲 **Random number generation**
- 🔢 **User input validation**
- 🔄 **Multiple attempts tracking**
- 🏆 **Displays the number of attempts**
- 🔄 **Option to replay the game**
- 🛠 **Error handling for invalid inputs**

## 🖥️ How to Run
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JustinMontero/Number_Guessing_Game.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd Number_Guessing_Game
   ```
3. **Compile the C++ file**:
   ```bash
   g++ -o guessing_game ngg.cpp
   ```
4. **Run the game**:
   ```bash
   ./guessing_game  # Linux/Mac
   guessing_game.exe  # Windows (if using MinGW)
   ```

## 🕹️ How to Play
1. The game will randomly pick a number.
2. The player inputs guesses.
3. The game provides feedback:
   - `"Too low! Try again."`
   - `"Too high! Try again."`
4. Once guessed correctly, the game displays:
   ```
   Great, you got it!!
   Number of attempts: X
   ```
5. The player is asked if they want to play again (`y/n`).

## 🔧 Requirements
- **C++ Compiler** (g++, clang, or MSVC)
- Works on **Windows, macOS, and Linux**

## 🏢 Future Improvements 
- [ ] Add difficulty levels
- [ ] Allow user to choose a number range
- [ ] Implement a leaderboard for best scores
- [ ] Add a timer to track guessing speed
